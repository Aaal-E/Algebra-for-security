\section{Run instructions}

% Include an explanation on how to install and run the software on a Windows platform.

% Describe what your approach is: how you represent various objects, how users should input polynomials, etc. Show, by including, for example, screenshots of your program at work, that your set-up works.

\subsection{Big integer representation (class BigNumber)}

The representation of big integers is done using an array of normal 32-bit integers.
Each element in the array corresponds to one digit from the original input.
For an original input of length $n$ digits, the element at index $0$ has the least significant digit,
index $n-1$ has the most significant digit, and index $n$ stores the sign of the integer.
If the value at index $n$ is 0, the sign is positive, if the value is $1$, the sign is negative.

As an example, if the input is $-345$, the resulting array is $\{5, 4, 3, 1\}$.
For the input $123$ the resulting array is $\{3, 2, 1, 0\}$.

\section{Integer arithmetic}

\subsection{Addition and subtraction (Integer/Adder.java)}

We start with determining whether we need to add the two numbers or whether we need to subtract.
Addition of a positive and a negative number is equivalent to subtraction of two positive numbers.
Addition of two negative numbers is equivalent to addition of two positive numbers, and adjusting the sign of the output
(\cite{ant} page 3, section 1.3.1).
This check is performed first in the function \texttt{add()}.
After checking, the \texttt{do\_add} or \texttt{do\_sub} function is ran.


\section{Discussion}

% Present some examples of different word sizes and radices, and compare elementary operation counts of primary school and Karatsuba methods. Draw a conclusion based on the theory.



\section{Limitations}

% Base > 32-bit?
