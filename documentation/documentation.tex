\section{Run instructions}

% Include an explanation on how to install and run the software on a Windows platform.

% Describe what your approach is: how you represent various objects, how users should input polynomials, etc. Show, by including, for example, screenshots of your program at work, that your set-up works.

\section{Code layout}

\paragraph{Big integer representation (class BigNumber)}

The representation of big integers is done using an array of normal 32-bit integers.
Each element in the array corresponds to one digit from the original input.
For an original input of length $n$ digits, the element at index $0$ has the least significant digit,
index $n-1$ has the most significant digit, and index $n$ stores the sign of the integer.
If the value at index $n$ is 0, the sign is positive, if the value is $1$, the sign is negative.

As an example, if the input is $-345$, the resulting array is $\{5, 4, 3, 1\}$.
For the input $123$ the resulting array is $\{3, 2, 1, 0\}$.
